ddns is a command-line client and server for modifying DNS entries.

Every non-option argument is assumed to be a domain name. For each domain
name, it looks for a DNS zone which can host that domain, and then creates or
updates an A or AAAA record in that zone to contain the current public IP
address.

ddns determines which DNS provider services to use by checking for keys in its
configuration database, which it finds at `./config.db` or
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/ddns/config.db`. Configuration values may also be supplied
in the environment (usually in the form `DDNS_<PROVIDER>_<VAR>`, for example
`DDNS_CLOUDFLARE_AUTH` to configure a CloudFlare provider using an API
token), or as command-line arguments, such as `--cloudflare-auth`.

It will return 0 if at least one record was updated, and non-zero if any other
error was encountered (you can check standard error to see what went wrong in
this case).
